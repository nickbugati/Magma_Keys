# Magma Keys

A simple application to play unique sound effects for each key press on the keyboard.

## Dependencies

1. **Python:** The script is written in Python. You need to have Python installed to run it.
2. **Pygame:** A Python library for building games (used for audio processing).
3. **keyboard:** A Python library to work with keyboards.
5. **ffmpeg:** This is required by PyDub to handle audio files.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Magma_Keys.git
   
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   
3. Install ffmpeg. Refer to the official [ffmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation instructions.

## Usage

1. Place your sound files (in mp3 format) inside the sounds directory.
2. Run `keyboard_sounds.py`:
   ```bash
   python keyboard_sounds.py

## Note
Ensure that the names of your sound files match the expected key names as defined in the `keyboard_sounds.py` script.

This branch is the same as `main`, except all the sound files are shorter.
